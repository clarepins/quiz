# A Quiz

In my process observation, I was asked to create a quiz. I clarified the user could interact using IRB, it could be multi-choice and the user would want to know wether the answer was correct straight away.

After the process, I practised two ways of stubbing user input saved in:
- quiz_stub_stdin and
- quiz_inject

## Instructions for use

in IRB:
- `q = Quizz_1.new`
- `q.run`

## Run tests

- $ `gem install rspec`
- $ `rspec`
